A simple Python script for URL fuzzing to test web applications for common security vulnerabilities.

## Overview

URL fuzzing is a security testing technique used to identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications or websites. This Python script allows you to systematically test different URLs or request parameters with various payloads to discover unexpected behavior or weaknesses.

## Features

- Fuzz URLs with a range of common payloads, including XSS, SQL injection, and directory traversal attempts.
- Easily customizable payload list to suit your testing needs.
- Provides a basic framework for identifying potentially vulnerable URLs.
- Requires Python 3.x and the `requests` library.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
    ```
4. Run the script
    ```
    python fuzer.py
    ```
5. Enter the target url whe prompted using the format given

6. The script will systematically test the URL with the specified payloads and report potentially vulnerable URLs.

## Customization 

You can customize the script by editing the payloads list in the script file. Add or modify payloads to match your testing requirements.
